### Greetings, salutations, and all that is commensurate

#### I haven't decided what I want to be when I grow up.

I have worked at the [Logo Lab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)),
designed [personal computer peripherals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathkit#Diversification_and_the_digital_era),
led software development at a [computer-vision-based medical startup](https://web.archive.org/web/19990427122056/http://www.proiris.com/irisbus/products/urinalysis/uasys.htm)
(in 1980! _seriously_ high tech),
designed [Atari personal computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari#Atari_Inc._(1972%E2%80%931984)),
written firmware for CD-ROM drives made by a half-dozen companies,
and helped start the [Open Education Foundation](https://OERfoundation.org/).

I've lived/worked in the USA, Japan, Singapore, and New Zealand.
