### Greetings, salutations, and all that is commensurate

#### I haven't decided what I want to be when I grow up.

I have worked at the Logo Lab,
designed computer peripherals, led software developement at a
computer-vision-based medical startup, designed personal computers,
written firmware for CD-ROM drives made by a half-dozen companies,
and helped start an education foundation.

I've lived in the USA, Japan, Singapore, and New Zealand.
